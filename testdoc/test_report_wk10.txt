**********************************************************************************************
Most of the features in the application are implemented and work well. The only big thing to fix is the add assets page. This is
because adding asset is vital to have any other working features in the application (i.e. No asset report w/o assets). 

Other suggestions I have is to add placeholders in your text boxes for the desired format. For example, if the user needs to enter
a date, maybe put something like 'MM/DD/YYYY' inside so that users know how to enter the input. This is only because there are different
ways dates and times may be entered (although you included that in the test plan which is good). This also may be why the add asset
page failed (I didn't enter the date right maybe).

You also may want to add links in your screens to return to the dashboard/login.

Overall, everything else works as expected. Code is organized and easy to read. Messages are unique and helpful as well.

Also, Riley seems cool and attractive. I should set him up with my hot friend (if I had any).
